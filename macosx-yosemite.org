* Mac OS X

  These modifications are specifically for the macOS X 10.10.5 Yosemite. It is
  possible, that many of them work for other versions of macOS as well, but
  they're only tested on that particular system. Especially the remapping of the
  Meta-key is different on newer versions of the Operating System.

** Delete to trash

   This variable lets emacs delete to the system trash rather than removing
   files directly.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package osx-trash
       :ensure t)

     (when (eq system-type 'darwin)
       (osx-trash-setup))
     (setq delete-by-moving-to-trash t)
   #+END_SRC

** Do not perform "--dired" check on ls

   This option might speed up the dired command, since macOS does not support
   the =--dired= flag in it's =ls= command anyway.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq dired-use-ls-dired nil)
   #+END_SRC

** Remap Meta Key

   Mac OS X uses the /alt/-key to get to certain characters. So the easiest way
   to remain functional with special characters is to remap the Meta-key to
   /Command/.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (if (boundp 'ns-command-modifier)
	 (setq ns-command-modifier 'meta))
     (if (boundp 'ns-option-modifier)
	 (setq ns-option-modifier nil))
   #+END_SRC
